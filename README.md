# Python-Practice
The initial request was to have a command line program that would ask the user for information about products they might be selling
and then write them to a JSON file. My team didn't know much about Python, so I created this very simple project to give them 
experience that would later be used in the creation of Seed Foundry (another project in my list of Github repositories).
